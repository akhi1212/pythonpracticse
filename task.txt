from Nitin Aran (privately):
Sequence of operations is given as a string which are separated by a single space. The following operations can be specified:
•    An integer X (from 0 to 220 -1): we push this number on the stack
•    “POP”: remove the topmost number from the stack
•    “DUP”: push a duplicate of the topmost number on the stack
•    “+”: pop two topmost elements, perform the sum, and push the sum on the stack
•    “-“: pop two topmost elements, substract the second from the first (topmost), and push the difference on the stack
After processing all the operations, return the topmost value from the stack
Errors:
•    An overflow in addition or underflow in subtraction
•    While trying to perform an operation, and we do not have enough elements in the stack
•    After all operations, if the stack is empty
For e.g. “13 DUP 4 POP 5 DUP + DUP + -“
Write a function for this behaviour where s is the string to be supplied
